# GraphQL / JSON:API Demo

This shows how graphql queries can be sent to a JSON:API server with polygraph.

## Setup

`npm install`
`node server.js`
`node index.js` (in a different console)

You can play with index.js to try out different queries.

## Limitations

Right now you can do attributes, relationships, and filtiering by ID. No mutations or anything else.
